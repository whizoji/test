## Opening the Virtual Desktop (Desktop Lite)

1. Rebuild and reopen the devcontainer (see instructions below).
2. Once the container is running, open the **Ports** panel in VS Code.
3. Find the port labeled `desktop` (usually 6080) and click the link to open the virtual desktop in your browser.
4. Log in with the default credentials if prompted (usually `vscode`/`vscode`).

## Rebuilding the DevContainer

- In VS Code, open the Command Palette (`F1` or `Ctrl+Shift+P`).
- Type and select: `Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container`.
- Wait for the rebuild to complete. The container will restart with the new configuration.
